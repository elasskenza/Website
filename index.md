> I am a **PhD candidate** in economics at the [Aix Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en/members/elass) â€“ Aix Marseille University.

I work on topics in **labour** and **gender economics**.

My research focuses on the analysis of the **supply-side effects on gender wage inequality**. My ongoing projects study the motives and effects of gender differences in the job search, labour supply and wage gaps along the distribution.

In 2022, I was a visiting scholar at the AXA Gender Lab at Bocconi University, sponsored by Paola Profeta.

You can view my CV here and learn more about and my research here
