## Welcome on my personnal website

> I am a **PhD candidate** in economics at the [Aix Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en/members/elass) and at the [Labour Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/) at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/programme-partenarial/chaires/chaire-travail/doctorants/).

* My research interests are in **applied labour**, in **gender** and **urban economics**. My research focuses on the analysis of the **supply-side effects on gender wage inequality**. My ongoing projects study the motives and effects of gender differences in the job search, labour supply and wage gaps along the distribution.

* In 2022, I was a visiting scholar at the AXA Gender Lab at Bocconi University, sponsored by Paola Profeta.

* You can view my CV here and learn more about and my research here

* I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ElassKenza).
